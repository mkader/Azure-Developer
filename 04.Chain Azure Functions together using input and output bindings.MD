# Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings

## Introduction
* Suppose you run a social networking site for professionals. You're allowing your users to upload their headshot images to be posted on their profile. 
* To reduce the workload on the web server, you want to create a serverless back end using Azure Functions to process this data.
* You want to create an image thumbnail and then save it to permanent storage.

## Explore input and output binding types
* Accessing and processing data are key tasks in many software solutions. Consider some of these scenarios:
    1. You've been asked to implement a way to move incoming data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure Cosmos DB.
    1. You want to post incoming messages to a queue for processing by another component in your enterprise.
    1. Your service needs to grab gamer scores from a queue and update an online scoreboard.
* All of these examples are about moving data. The data source and destinations differ from scenario to scenario, but the pattern is similar. 
* connect to a data source, and you read and write data. Azure Functions helps you integrate with data and services by using bindings.

* What is a binding?
    1. In Azure Functions, bindings provide a declarative way to connect to data from within your code. They make it easier to integrate with data streams consistently in a function. 
    1. can have multiple bindings providing access to different data elements. This integration is powerful because you can connect to your data sources without having to code specific connection logic (like database connections or web API interfaces).

* Types of bindings - There are two kinds of bindings you can use with functions:
    1. Input binding - Connects to a data source. Our function can read data from these input sources.
    1. Output binding - Connects to a data destination. Our function can write data to these output destinations.
    1. There are also triggers, which are special types of input bindings that cause a function to run. For example, an Azure Event Grid notification can be configured as a trigger. When an event occurs, the function runs.

* Types of supported bindings
    1. The type of binding defines where we're reading or sending data. There's a binding to respond to web requests, and a large selection of bindings to interact directly with various Azure services and third-party services.
    1. A binding type can be used as an input, an output, or both. For example, a function can write to a Blob Storage output binding, but a Blob Storage update could trigger another function.
    1. Common binding types include: Blob Storage, Azure Service Bus Queues, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Event Hubs, External files, External tables, HTTP endpoints

* Binding properties - 3 properties are required in all bindings, might have to supply more properties based on the type of binding and storage you're using.
    1. Name - Defines the function parameter through which you access the data. For example, in a queue input binding, this property is the name of the function parameter that receives the queue message content.
    1. Type - Identifies the type of binding. For example, the type of data or service you want to interact with.
    1. Direction - Indicates the direction data is flowing. For example, is it an input or output binding?
    1. Additionally, most binding types also need a fourth property:
        1. Connection - Provides the name of an app setting key that contains the connection string. Bindings use connection strings stored in app settings to keep secrets out of the function code. Connection strings make your code more configurable and secure.

* Create a binding
    1. Bindings are defined in JSON. A binding is configured in your function's configuration file (function.json) and lives in the same folder as your function code.
    1. Let's examine a sample input binding:
    ```
        {
        "name": "headshotBlob",
        "type": "blob",
        "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}",
        "connection": "HeadshotStorageConnection",
        "direction": "in"
        },
    ```
    1. To create this binding, we:
        1. Create a binding in our function.json file.
        1. Provide the value for the name variable. In this example, the variable holds the blob data.
        1. Provide the storage type. In the preceding example, we're using Blob Storage.
        1. Provide the path, which specifies the container and the item name that goes in it. 
            1. The path property is required when using the blob trigger, with curly braces around the filename portion of the path. 
            1. This syntax creates a binding expression that allows you to reference the blob's name in other bindings, and in your function's code. 
            1. In this example, a parameter on the function named filename would be populated with the filename of the blob that triggered the function.
        1. Provide the connection string setting name defined in the application's settings file. It's used as a key to find the connection string to connect to your storage account.
        1. Define the direction as in. It reads data from the blob.
    1. Bindings are used to connect to data in your function. In this example, we used an input binding to connect user images for processing by our function as thumbnails.

## Exercise - Explore input and output binding types
* create a function that runs when it receives an HTTP request, and responds to each request by returning a message.
* ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/media/3-default-http-trigger-implementation-javascript-small.png)
* The parameter req is the trigger binding, and the parameter res is the output binding. 

* Create a function app (Code, Node.js) - A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

* Create a HTTP trigger function -> Authorization level (default value Function) -> Get Function Url -> Run wiht name query string
    1. Authorization level determines what keys need to be present on the request in order for it to run. 
    1. Function authorization level requires a function-specific key, which we can find once it's created.
    1. Must define a trigger when you create a function. Each function has a single trigger. 
    1. In this example, function starts when it receives an HTTP request. 
    1. If no query string was provided, the function responds with a message that asks whomever is calling to supply a name value.

* Explore binding types
    1. Function -> select Integration -> Already defined a trigger and an output binding
    1. ![Alt text](image-2.png)
    1. can't add more than one trigger. To change a trigger for a function, you need to delete the trigger and create a new one.
    1. the Inputs and Outputs sections enable you to add more than one binding, so the request can accept more than one input value and return more than one output value.
    1. Inputs box -> select Add input -> Binding Type (view a list of all possible input binding types).

## Read data with input bindings
* To connect to a data source, need to configure an input binding. 
* An input binding makes it possible to write minimal code to create a message. 
* No need to write code for tasks, such as opening a storage connection; the Azure Functions runtime and binding take care of those tasks for you.

* Input binding types
    1. Azure chain functions can have multiple types of input. However, not all types support both input and output. 
    1. Use an input function whenever you want to ingest data of that type. 
    1. [Here, we look at the input function types that support input bindings and when to use them.
        1. Azure Blob Storage - bindings allow you to read from a blob](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings?tabs=isolated-process%2Cpython-v2&pivots=programming-language-csharp#supported-bindings).
        1. Azure Cosmos DB - bindings use the SQL API to retrieve one or more Azure Cosmos DB documents, and pass them to the input parameter of the function. The document ID, or query parameters, can be determined based on the trigger that invokes the function.
        1. Mobile Apps - binding loads a record from a mobile table endpoint and passes it into your function.
        1. Azure Table storage - can read data and work with Azure Table storage.
    1. To create a binding as an input, you must define direction as in. The parameters for each type of binding might vary.

* What is a binding expression?
    1. A binding expression is specialized text in function.json, function parameters, or code that is evaluated when the function is invoked, to yield a value. 
    1. For example, if you have a Service Bus Queue binding, you could use a binding expression to obtain the name of the queue from App Settings.
    1. Types of binding expressions: App settings, Trigger filename, Trigger metadata, JSON payloads, New GUID, Current date and time
    1. Most binding expressions are identified by being wrapped in curly braces. 
    1. However, app setting binding expressions are wrapped in percent signs, rather than curly braces. 
    1. For example, if the blob output binding path is %Environment%/newblob.txt, and the Environment app setting value is Development, a blob is created in the Development container.

* Summary
    1. Input bindings allow you to connect your function to a data source. 
    1. can connect to several types of data sources, and the parameters for each vary. 
    1. To resolve values from input sources, use binding expressions in the function.json file, in function parameters, or in code.

## Read data with input bindings
* create a bookmark lookup service. Initially, your service is read-only. If users want to find an entry, they send a request with the ID of the entry, and our function returns the URL. The following flowchart illustrates the logical flow.
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/media/5-find-bookmark-flow-small.png)

* When a user sends a request with text, the find bookmark function tries to find an entry in your database that contains a bookmark with the text as a key or ID. The system returns a result that indicates whether you found the entry.

* When the Azure function receives a request with a bookmark ID, it first checks whether the request is valid. If it isn't, an error response is generated. 
* If the request is valid, the function checks whether the bookmark ID exists in the Azure Cosmos DB database. If it doesn't exist, an error response is generated. If the bookmark ID is found, a success response is generated.

* Store the data in an Azure Cosmos DB instance.

* Create an Azure Cosmos DB account -> Search Azure Cosmos DB -> Select Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL -> Create -> Accept the default values

* Add a container
    1. In an Azure Cosmos DB, a container is used to store various user-generated entities, also called items. create a container called Bookmarks.
    1. ![Alt text](image-3.png) 
    1. Azure Cosmos DB -> Data Explorer -> New Container -> Accept the defaults -> Ok
    1. Enter the setting value -> Database id (func-io-learn-db), Database Max RU/s (4000), Container id (Bookmarks), Partition key (/id)
        1. the default throughput of 4000 request units per second (RU/s). To reduce latency, you can scale up the performance later.	
        1. The partition key specifies how the documents in Azure Cosmos DB collections are distributed across logical data partitions. 
        1. Use the Partition key setting as a convenience here because not concerned with database performance
         in this module. To learn more about Azure Cosmos DB partition key strategies, explore the Microsoft Learn Azure Cosmos DB modules.
    1. When complete, the Data Explorer displays func-io-learn-db in DATA under NOSQL API.
        1. Select func-io-learn-db to expand it, it contains several child members, including Scale and Bookmarks.
        1. Expand the Bookmarks container, and notice that it's prepopulated with several child members.
    1. ![](image-4.png)

* Add test data -> select Items -> select New Item -> Add the JSON code > Save.
    ```
    {
        "id": "docs",
        "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/azure"
    }
    ```
![Alt text](image-5.png)
* if a request arrives with "id=docs", it looks up that ID in your Bookmarks container, and returns the URL https://learn.microsoft.com/azure. 
* More properties added. They all begin with an underline (_rid, _self, _etag, _attachments, _ts). These are system generated to help manage the items that you add to the container.

    | Property	| Description |
    | -- | -- |
    | _rid	| Resource ID is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It's used internally for placement and navigation of the item resource. |
    | _self	| nique addressable URI for the resource. |
    | _etag	| Required for optimistic concurrency control. |
    | _attachments	| Addressable path for the attachments resource. |
    | _ts	| Timestamp of the last update of this resource. |

* Add more items
    ```
        {
            "id": "portal",
            "url": "https://portal.azure.com"
        }
        {
            "id": "learn",
            "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/training"
        }
        {
            "id": "marketplace",
            "url": "https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps"
        }
        {
            "id": "blog",
            "url": "https://azure.microsoft.com/blog"
        }
    ```
* Create your function
    1. Go to Function App -> HttpTrigger1 -> Create another HTTP trigger (HttpTrigger2) with default settings.
    1. Verify the function Url by pass with &name=<you name>.
    
* Add an Azure Cosmos DB input binding
To read data from the database, you need to define an input binding. As you see here, you can configure a binding that can talk to your database in just a few steps.

In the Azure portal, in the HttpTrigger2 Function menu on the left, select Integration. The Integration pane for your Function appears.

You used a template that created an HTTP trigger request with an HTTP output binding. Let's add an Azure Cosmos DB input binding.

In the Inputs box, select Add input. The Create Input pane appears.

From the Binding Type dropdown list, select Azure Cosmos DB.

In the Azure Cosmos DB details section, under the Cosmos DB account connection setting, select the New link. The New Cosmos DB connection dialog box appears.

If a message appears prompting you to install the Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB extension, select Install and wait for it to finish.

By default, Azure recognizes the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier. Select OK to set up a connection to your database. A new connection to the database account is configured and appears in the Cosmos DB account connection field.

We want to look up a bookmark with a specific ID, so let's tie the ID that we receive in the query string to the binding.

Let's complete the settings in the Create Input pane. Enter the following values for each setting. To learn more about the purpose of each setting, select the information icon on that field.

Setting	Value	Description
Document parameter name	bookmark	The name used to identify this binding in your code.
Database name	func-io-learn-db	The database to work with. This value is the database name we set.
Collection Name	Bookmarks	The collection we read the data from. This setting was defined.
Document ID	id	Add the Document ID that we defined when we created the Bookmarks Azure Cosmos DB container.
Partition key	/id	Add the partition key that you defined when you created the Bookmarks Azure Cosmos DB collection. The key entered here (specified in input binding format <key>) must match the one in the collection.
SQL Query (optional)	Leave blank	You're only retrieving one document at a time based on the ID. So, filtering with the Document ID setting is a better than using a SQL Query in this instance. You could craft a SQL Query to return one entry (SELECT * from b where b.ID = id). That query would indeed return a document, but it would return it in a document collection. Your code would have to manipulate a collection unnecessarily. Use the SQL Query approach when you want to get multiple documents.
To clarify why we're using these settings, we want to look up a bookmark with a specific ID, so we tied the Document ID that our function receives in the query string to the input binding. This syntax is known as a binding expression. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID to look up. Because IDs are unique in our collection, the binding returns either 0 (not found) or 1 (found) documents.

To save this input binding configuration, select OK.

Update the function implementation
Now that your binding is defined, you can use it in your function. You need to make two changes to implement the binding that you created:

Modify your function's language-specific implementation code. It needs to determine whether a document was found in the database that matches the ID that is passed to the function.

Modify your function's JSON implementation code to accept a parameter that is passed in the query string.

Modify your function's JavaScript implementation code
In the Function menu for your HttpTrigger2 function, select Code + Test. The Code + Test pane appears for your HttpTrigger2 function.

Replace all code in the index.js file with the following code.

JavaScript

Copy
module.exports = function (context, req) {

    var bookmark = context.bindings.bookmark

    if(bookmark){
        context.res = {
        body: { "url": bookmark.url },
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        };
    }
    else {
        context.res = {
            status: 404,
            body : "No bookmarks found",
            headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        };
    }

    context.done();
};
In the command bar, select Save. Select Filesystem Logs in the drop-down at the top center of the logs pane (which displays App Insights Logs by default). The Logs pane appears, showing you have Connected!

Let's examine what this code is doing.

An incoming HTTP request triggers the function, and an id query parameter is passed to the Azure Cosmos DB input binding.

If the database finds a document that matches this ID, the bookmark parameter is set to the located document.

In this example, the code constructs a response that contains the URL value that is found in the corresponding document of the database.

If no document is found matching this key, the request would respond with a payload and status code that tells the user the bad news.

Modify your function's JSON implementation code
Select function.json from the dropdown list in your <functionapp> \ HttpTrigger2 \ path.

Modify the values for id and partitionKey so that they accept a parameter of {id}. Your function.json code should resemble the following example, where your-database is replaced with the name of your Cosmos DB database.

JSON

Copy
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    },
    {
      "name": "bookmark",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "cosmosDB",
      "connection": "your-database_DOCUMENTDB",
      "databaseName": "func-io-learn-db",
      "containerName": "Bookmarks",
      "id": "{id}",
      "partitionKey": "{id}"
    }
  ]
}
In the command bar, select Save.

Try it out
You should already be on the Code + Test pane for your HttpTrigger2 function.

In the command bar, select Get function URL. The Get function URL dialog box appears.

From the Key dropdown list, select default under Function key, and then select the Copy to clipboard icon at the end of the URL.

Paste the function key you copied into the address bar of a new browser tab, and then add the query string value &id=docs to the end of the URL. The resulting URL should resemble the following example:

https://example.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger2?code=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz==&id=docs

Press Enter to run the request. The response returned by your function should be similar to the following example.

JSON

Copy
{
  "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/azure"
}
Replace &id=docs with &id=missing, press Enter, and observe the response. We defined five bookmarks, and created a meaningful error response if the requested bookmark doesn't exist.

In this unit, you created your first input binding manually to read from an Azure Cosmos DB database. The amount of code you wrote to search our database and read data was minimal, thanks to bindings. You did most of your work configuring the binding declaratively, and the platform took care of the rest.

In the next unit, you'll add more data to our bookmarks collection through an Azure Cosmos DB output binding.

Next unit: Write data with output bindings
