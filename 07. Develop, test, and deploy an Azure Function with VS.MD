# Develop, test, and deploy an Azure Function with Visual Studio

## Create and test a simple Azure Function locally with Visual Studio
* Users can write, debug, and deploy an Azure Function from within the Azure portal. 
* Writing functions directly in a production, staging, or test environment might not be suitable. 
    1. Example, Writing automated unit tests for Azure Functions, or using on-demand deployment of Azure Functions to Function Apps in Azure. 
* VS/VSC enables you to develop and manage Azure Functions code using other code and services in a single project.

* Modify Visual Studio Install
    1. Visual Studio Installer -> Workloads tab -> select the ASP.NET and Web development, Azure development checkboxes -> Modify.

* Azure Functions Tools extension for Visual Studio
    1. Azure Functions Tools is a VS extension that enables you to create, test, and deploy Azure Functions in your local development environment. 
    1. To quickly create a new Azure Function App, this extension provides a template for you to build and then deploy a function directly to Azure from Visual Studio.
    1. The Azure Functions and Web Jobs Tools extension is included in Visual Studio 2022.

* Azure Function App
    1. A function app hosts one or more functions. It provides the environment and runtime for your function code.
    1. A function is triggered by an event rather than being called directly from an app. You specify the type of event that will trigger each function in your Azure Function App. The events available include:
        1. Blob trigger - runs when a file is uploaded or modified in Azure Blob storage.
        1. Event Hub trigger -  runs the function when an Event Hub receives a message.
        1. Azure Cosmos DB trigger - runs when a document is added to, or modified in db. Use this trigger to integrate Azure Cosmos DB with other services. For example, if a document representing a customer's order is added to a database, you could use a trigger to send a copy of the order to a queue for processing.
        1. Http trigger - runs the function when an HTTP request occurs in a web app. use this trigger to respond to webhooks. A webhook is a callback that occurs when an item hosted by a website is modified. For example, you can create a function that is triggered by a webhook from a GitHub repository when an item in the repository changes.
        1. Queue trigger - starts the function when a new item is added to an Azure Storage Queue.
        1. Service Bus Queue trigger - runs the function when a new item is added to an Azure Service Bus Queue.
        1. Service Bus Topic trigger - runs the function in response to a new message arriving on a Service Bus Topic.
        1. Timer trigger - runs the function at regular intervals, following a schedule that you define.
    1. ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-visual-studio/media/2-function-triggers.png)
    
    1. table shows the highest level of .NET Core or .NET Framework that you can use with a specific version of Functions.
        | Functions runtime version | In-process | Isolated worker process |
        | -- | -- | -- |
        | Functions 4.x	| .NET 6.0	| .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0, .NET Framework 4.8 |
        | Functions 1.x	| .NET Framework 4.8 |	n/a |

    1. An Azure Function App stores management information, code, and logs in Azure storage. 
        1. Create a Storage Account to hold this data. The storage account must support Azure Blob, Queue, Files, and Table storage; use a general Azure Storage account for this purpose. 

    1. A function can perform privileged or sensitive operations. 
        1. A function triggered by an HTTP request could be exposed publicly. 
        1. limit the ability to run this function to selected groups of users. 
        1. protect a function by specifying the access rights required to trigger the function. 
        1. A function triggered by an HTTP request supports three levels of access rights:
            1. Anonymous -  No authentication is required, and any user can trigger the function.
            1. Function -  The HTTP request must provide a key that enables the Azure Function runtime to authorize the request. You create this key separately, and you can maintain it using the Azure portal.
            1. Admin -  Similar to Function. The user must specify a key with the HTTP request that triggers the function. The difference is that the key is an admin key. This key can be used to access any function in the function app. As with a function key, you create this key separately.

* Structure of an Azure Function
    1. An Azure Function is implemented as a static class. The class provides a static, asynchronous method named Run, which acts as the entry point for the class.
    1. The parameters passed to the Run method provide the context for the trigger. 
        1. In the case of an HTTP trigger, the function receives an HttpRequest object. 
        1. This object contains the header and body of the request. 
    1. Code - name the query string, uses a StreamReader to deserialize the body of the request (read name)
        ```
        public static class Function1
        {
            [FunctionName("Function1")]
            public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
                [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
                ILogger log)
            {
                log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

                string name = req.Query["name"];

                string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
                dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
                name = name ?? data?.name;

                return name != null
                    ? (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}")
                    : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body");
            }
        }
        ```
        1. The function returns a value containing output data and results, wrapped in an IActionResult object. 
        1. The value is returned in the body of the HTTP response for the request.

    1. Different types of triggers receive different input parameters and return types. 
    1. Blob trigger - the contents of the blob are returned through a Stream object, and the name of the blob is also provided.
    1. No data is returned by the trigger; its purpose is to read and process the data in the named blob.
        ```public static class Function2
        {
            [FunctionName("Function2")]
            public static void Run([BlobTrigger("samples-workitems/{name}", Connection = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")]Stream myBlob, string name, ILogger log)
            {
                log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} Bytes");
            }
        }
        ```
        1. a function is passed an ILogger parameter, write log messages, which the function app will write to storage for later analysis.
    1. A function also contains metadata that specifies the type of the trigger, security requirements, and any other specific information requirements. 
        1. can modify metadata using the HttpTrigger, BlobTrigger, or other trigger attributes, as shown in the examples. 
        1. The FunctionName attribute that precedes a function is an identifier for the function used by the Function App. 
        1. This name doesn't have to be the same as the name of the function, but it's good practice to keep them synchronized.

* Test an Azure Function App locally
    1. use the Visual Debugger (Press F5) to build and test an Azure Function App locally. 
    1. The local version of the Function Runtime will start for testing. 
    1. Open URL to test it
    1. While the code is running, see trace messages appearing in the Function Runtime window. 

## Exercise - Create and test a simple Azure Function locally with Visual Studio
* Create a new project 
    1. Select Azure Functions template -> Project name (WatchPortalFunction) ->  Function trigger (Http trigger), Use Azurite for runtime storage account (AzureWebJobsStorage)	(Checked), Authorization level (Anonymous) -> Create.
    1. ![] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-visual-studio/media/3-function-triggers.png)
    1. VS creates the WatchPortalFunction project and displays the Functions App source code file Function1.cs
        1. the Function1 class contains boilerplate code from the HTTP trigger template. 
        1. The Run method is annotated with the [FunctionName ("Function1")] attribute. 
        ```        
        namespace WatchPortalFunction
        {
            public static class Function1
            {
                [FunctionName("Function1")]
                public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
                [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
                ILogger log)
                {
                    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

                    string name = req.Query["name"];

                    string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
                    dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
                    name = name ?? data?.name;

                    return name != null
                        ? (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}")
                        : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body");
                }
            }
        }
        ```
* Create the WatchInfo Azure Function
    1. Solution Explorer -> Add > New Azure Function -> Name (WatchInfo.cs), Http trigger, Authorization (Anonymous) -> Add.
    1. ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-visual-studio/media/3-new-azure-function.png)
    1. VS creates a new function and the Run method is annotated with the [FunctionName("WatchInfo")] attribute.
    1. Delete the code after the log.LogInformation line. The result should look like this.
        ```
        namespace WatchPortalFunction
        {
            public static class WatchInfo
            {
                [FunctionName("WatchInfo")]
                public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
                    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
                    ILogger log)
                {
                    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
                }
            }
        }

        // Insert the following code in the body of the Run method after log.LogInformation line.

        // Retrieve the model id from the query string
        string model = req.Query["model"];

        // If the user specified a model id, find the details of the model of watch
        if (model != null)
        {
            // Use dummy data for this example
            dynamic watchinfo = new { Manufacturer = "abc", CaseType = "Solid", Bezel = "Titanium", Dial = "Roman", CaseFinish = "Silver", Jewels = 15 };

            return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Watch Details: {watchinfo.Manufacturer}, {watchinfo.CaseType}, {watchinfo.Bezel}, {watchinfo.Dial}, {watchinfo.CaseFinish}, {watchinfo.Jewels}");
        }
       return new BadRequestObjectResult("Please provide a watch model in the query string");
        ```
* Test the Azure Function locally -> Press F5 -> Run URL pass with ?model=abc.

## Publish a simple Azure Function
* Your function code runs in Azure in the context of a function app. 
* A function app defines the operating system and resources, such as the memory, computing power, and disk space, for running your function code. It provides the base address for accessing your functions. 
* The function app is dynamically scaled when your functions need more resources.

* Deploy from Visual Studio
    1. The Publish wizard helps connect to your Azure account, and prompts you to either specify an existing function app, or create a new one. 
    1. The functions in your project are then rebuilt and deployed to the function app in Azure.

* Continuous deployment
    1. Azure Functions makes it easy to deploy your function app using App Service continuous integration. 
    1. ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-visual-studio/media/4-deployment-center.png)
    1. You can configure continuous deployment from the Azure portal, using the Deployment Center feature of an Azure Functions App. Deployment is configured on a per-function app basis.

* Zip deployment
    1. Azure Functions can be deployed from a zip file using push deployment, either from the Azure CLI, or by using the REST interface.
    1. The zip file contains the executable code for your functions. Zip deployment copies these files to the wwwwroot folder in the Azure Function App. You can perform zip deployment using the functionapp deployment command in the Azure CLI.
        ```
        az functionapp deployment source config-zip \
        -g <resource-group> \
        -n <function-app-name> \
        --src <zip-file>
        ```
## Exercise - Publish a simple Azure Function

* Create an Azure Function App using the Azure portal
* VS -> Solution Explorer -> WatchPortalFunction project -> Publish -> Azure -> Azure Function App (Windows) -> your Function App -> Publish -> 
* Verify -> Get URL run with /api/watchinfo, ?model=abc

## Exercise - Unit test an Azure Function

* Create a xUnit test project
* add Nuget Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package
* Add Project Reference.
* Test code

    ```
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions;
    Change the name of the Test1 method to TestWatchFunctionSuccess.
