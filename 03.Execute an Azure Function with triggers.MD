# Execute an Azure Function with triggers

* A trigger is responsible for executing an Azure function and there are dozens of triggers to choose from.

## Introduction
* Imagine a scenario where a busy hair salon has a recurring problem: customers commonly miss their appointments. 
* Appointments are reserved time slots, so if a customer misses an appointment, the salon loses money. 
* To improve the situation, send two types of reminder text messages, one that's sent as soon as the appointment is scheduled or changed, and a text message sent each morning to each customer who has an appointment that day.
* create a service that can be easily scheduled, updated, and scaled. 
* solve this problem using Azure Functions. Learn how to send the message at a specific time or when a specific event occurs. 
* Azure Functions supports a feature called triggers. Triggers are used to invoke your function code in Azure.

## Determine the best trigger for your Azure function
* A single function in Azure Functions doesn't do work until something tells it to execute. For example, we could create a function to send out a reminder text message to our customers before an appointment. If we don't tell the function when it should run, our customers will never receive a message.

* What is a trigger?
  1. A trigger is an object that defines a specific function. For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.
  1. Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.

* Types of triggers - Azure Functions supports a wide range of trigger types. Here are some of the most common types:

    | Type	| Purpose |
    | -- | -- |
    | Timer	| Execute a function at a set interval |
    | HTTP	| Execute a function when an HTTP request is received |
    | Blob	| Execute a function when a file is uploaded or updated in Azure Blob storage |
    | Queue	| Execute a function when a message is added to an Azure Storage queue |
    | Azure Cosmos DB	| Execute a function when a document changes in a collection |
    | Azure SQL	| Execute a function when a row changes in a table |
    | Event Hub	| Execute a function when an event hub receives a new event |
    | Event Grid	| Execute a function based on Event Grid subscriptions |

* What is a binding?
  1. A binding is a connection to data within your function. 
  1. Bindings are optional and can be input bindings, output bindings, or both. 
    1. An input binding lets your function read data from another service. 
    1. An output binding lets your function write data to another service.
  1. Unlike a trigger, a function can have multiple input bindings and output bindings. 
  1. If you choose not to use bindings at all, you can still access services using client SDKs.

* What is a function app?
  1. Azure Functions lets you group one or more functions into a single function app. 
  1. All functions in a function app share the same resources, app settings, and deployments.

## Run an Azure Function on a schedule
* It's common to execute a piece of logic at a set interval. 
* Imagine you're a blog owner, and you notice that your subscribers aren't reading your most recent posts. You decide that the best action is to send an email once a week to remind them to check your blog. You implement this logic by creating a function app in Azure with a timer trigger to invoke your function weekly.

* What is a timer trigger?
  1. A timer trigger is a trigger that executes a function at a consistent interval. 
  1. To create a timer trigger, you need to supply two pieces of information.
      1. <ins>A Timestamp parameter name</ins>, which is simply an identifier to access the trigger in code.
      1. <ins>A Schedule</ins>, which is a CRON expression that sets the interval for the timer.

* What is a CRON expression?
  1. A CRON expression is a string that consists of six fields that represent a set of times.
  1. The order of the six fields in Azure is: {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.
  1. To build a CRON expression, you need to have a basic understanding of some of the special characters.
  
    | Special character	| Meaning	| Example | 
    | -- | --|--| 
    | *	| Selects every value in a field	| An asterisk "*" in the day of the week field means every day.|
    | ,	| Separates items in a list	| A comma "1,3" in the day of the week field means just Mondays (day 1) and Wednesdays (day 3).| 
    | -	| Specifies a range	| A hyphen "10-12" in the hour field means a range that includes the hours 10, 11, and 12.| 
    | /	| Specifies an increment	| A slash "*/10" in the minutes field means an increment of every 10 minutes.| 

  1. Example: 0 */5 * * * *
    1. 1st field represents <ins>seconds (the values 0-59)</ins>. The field contains a "0", it selects the 1st possible value, which is "1" second.
    1. 2nd field represents <ins>minutes</ins>. The value "*/5" contains two special characters. 
        1. 1st, the asterisk (*) means "select every value within the field." Because this field represents minutes, the possible values are 0-59. 
        1. 2nd, the slash (/), which represents an increment. 
        1. It means for all values 0-59, select every fifth value. (that is simply "every five minutes.")
    1. The remaining four fields numerically represent the hour in a 24-hour day, day in the month, month in a 12-month year, and day of the 7-day week. 
        1. An *, means to select every possible value. In this example, we select "every hour of every day of every month."
    1. Finally, the expression is read as "the first second of every fifth minute of every hour, of every day, of every month".

* How to create a timer trigger
  1. Function app -> select timer trigger -> Enter the logic that you want to execute. Supply a Timestamp parameter name and the CRON expression.

## Exercise - Create a timer trigger
* create an Azure Function app that's invoked every 20 seconds using a timer trigger.
* Create an Azure Function App
  1. Portal -> Create a resource -> Function App -> Create
  1. Basics tab -> Publish (Code), Runtime stack (.NET), Operating System (Windows), Plan type (Consumption (Serverless)). 
  1. Storage -> New or existing one -> Create
  
* Create and configure a timer-triggered function
  1. Function App menu -> Functions tab -> Select the Create in Azure portal button -> select Timer trigger -> Under Template details -> Schedule field (*/20 * * * * *) -> Create.

* Test the timer
  1. TimerTrigger1 pane -> Code + Test -> Logs session pane -> App Insight Logs drop-down -> select Filesystem Logs
  1. Observe that a new message arrives every 20 seconds in the log pane.
  1. To stop the function -> Stop
  1. To disable the function -> TimerTrigger1 menu -> Overview -> select Disable

## Execute an Azure function with an HTTP request
* Azure Functions allows us to quickly create a piece of logic to execute when an HTTP request is received.

* What is an HTTP trigger?
  1. An HTTP trigger is a trigger that executes code when it receives an HTTP request. 
  1. HTTP triggers have many capabilities and customizations, including:
      1. Providing authorized access by supplying keys.
      1. Restricting which HTTP verbs are supported.
      1. Returning data back to the caller.
      1. Receiving data through query string parameters or through the request body.
      1. Supporting URL route templates to modify the function URL.
  1. When you create an HTTP trigger, you need to provide a name for the trigger and choose an Authorization level.

* What is an HTTP trigger Authorization level?
  1. An HTTP trigger Authorization level is a flag that indicates whether an incoming HTTP request needs an API key for authorization.
  1. There are three Authorization levels: <ins>Function, Anonymous, Admin</ins>
      1. <ins>The Function and Admin levels</ins> are "key" based. 
          1. To send an HTTP request, you must supply a key for authorization. 
          1. There are two types of keys: <ins>function and host</ins>. 
          1. The difference between the two keys is their scope. 
              1. <ins>Function keys</ins> are specific to a function. 
              1. <ins>Host keys</ins> apply to all functions inside the function app. 
          1. If your Authorization level is set to Function, you can use either a function or a host key. 
          1. If your Authorization level is set to Admin, you must supply a host key.
          1. Because host keys provide elevated access to your function app, you must transport and store them securely.
      1. <ins>The Anonymous level</ins> means that authorization isn't required. This exercise uses the Anonymous authorization level.

* How to create an HTTP trigger
  1. Just like a timer trigger -> select HTTP trigger -> enter the logic that you want to execute and make any customizations, like restricting the use of certain HTTP verbs.
  1. One important setting is <ins>Request parameter name</ins> - is a string that represents the name of the parameter that contains the information about an incoming HTTP request. By default, the name of the parameter is req.

* How to invoke an HTTP trigger
  1. Send an HTTP request to the URL (Get function URL link) for your function.
  1. Either use query-string parameters or supply the data through the request body.
  1. An HTTP trigger executes when it receives an HTTP request to its function URL. 
  1. HTTP triggers allow you to receive data, execute logic, and optionally return data back to the caller.

## Exercise - Create an HTTP trigger
* create a function that accepts an HTTP request with a single string. The function returns a string back to the caller to represent success or failure.

* Create an HTTP trigger
  1. Function App -> select HTTP trigger -> Template details section -> New Function field (enter a name) -> Authorization level dropdown list (select Anonymous) -> Create. 
  1. Code + Test -> Review code -> The req parameter represents the incoming request and contains a name parameter. 
  1. Check to see if name has a value. If it does, we return a greeting. Otherwise, it continues to ask for a value.
  1. Get your function URL -> Run; for example, https://<your-webapp-name>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?name=Jesse
  1. The message, Hello, Jesse. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. displays.

## Execute an Azure function when a blob is created
* Imagine you're a photographer and you have a website that displays your pictures of the day. 
* Because you're busy, you don't have a consistent upload schedule, but you want to notify your fans when you upload a picture.
* You decide to create an Azure function to automatically send a tweet whenever you upload an image to your Azure Storage blob container.
* Learn how to create a blob trigger and instruct it to monitor a specific location in your Azure Storage blob container.

* What is Azure Storage?
  1. Azure Storage is MS's cloud storage solution that supports all types of data, including: blobs, queues, and NoSQL. 
  1. The goal of Azure Storage is to provide data storage that's: <ins>Highly available, Secure, Scalable, Managed</ins>

* What is Azure Blob storage?
  1. Azure Blob storage is an object-storage solution that's designed to store large amounts of unstructured data.
  1. For example, Azure Blob storage is great at doing things like: <ins>Storing files, Serving files, Streaming video and audio, Logging data</ins>
  1. There are three types of blobs: <ins>block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs</ins>. 
      1. <ins>Block blobs</ins> are the most common type. They allow you to store text or binary data efficiently. 
      1. <ins>Append blobs</ins> are like block blobs, but they're designed more for append operations like creating a log file that's being constantly updated. 
      1. <ins>Page blobs</ins> are made up of pages and are designed for frequent random read and write operations.

* What is a blob trigger?
  1. A blob trigger is a trigger that executes a function when you upload or update a file in Azure Blob storage. 
  1. Functions periodically checks a storage container for changes, which can result in some latency. 
  1. There are ways to reduce this latency when triggering on blob containers.
  1. To create a blob trigger, you create an Azure Storage account and provide a location that the trigger monitors.

* How to create a blob trigger
  1. Just like the other triggers -> select Blob trigger -> enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.
  1. One important setting <ins> the Path</ins> - tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is: <ins>samples-workitems/{name}</ins>
      1. The first part, samples-workitems, represents the blob container that the trigger monitors. 
      1. The second part, {name} means that every type of file will cause the trigger to invoke the function. 
  1. The function is invoked because there's no filter. For example, we could make the trigger invoke the function only when a PNG file is added by using syntax like: samples-workitems/{name}.png
  1. The last significant piece of information for this concept is the text name. The name represents a parameter in your Azure function that receives the name of the added file. For example, if we upload a file named resume.txt, my Azure function receives that value as a string through a parameter called name.

* A blob trigger invokes an Azure function when it sees activity at a specific location in your Azure Storage blob account. You set the location to monitor by modifying the Path value in the Azure portal.

## Exercise - Create a Blob trigger
* create an Azure function that displays the name and size of a blob when it's created or updated.

* Create a blob trigger 
  1. Create Function App Resource -> select Azure Blob Storage trigger 
      1. If you see a message saying Extensions not installed, select Install. (take minutes)
  1. Template details -> the New Function field (default value), the Path field (default value).
  1. the Storage account connection dropdown list -> select the New link -> select the storage account for this function app.
 
* Create a blob container -> storage account -> Select Blob containers -> Add container -> Name (samples-workitems) -> accept the default Private setting -> Create.

* Turn on your blob trigger -> Code + Test -> select Filesystem Logs

* Create a blob -> storage account -> Select Storage Browser -> Authentication method (select Switch to Access key) -> Upload

* Azure Function -> check the output logs for a message that displays which file was uploaded. 
    1. Your blob trigger should automatically execute. 
    1. If you select Test/Run from the top menu bar, and then select Run in the function pane, it might result in an error due to the default value that is specified in the Test request body. 
    1. Change the path from the Input tab in the request Body pane to a valid file for the test to run successfully.

## Check your knowledge

  1. A CRON expression is a string that consists of six fields that represent a set of times. The order of the six fields in Azure is: {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}. Suppose you needed a CRON expression that meant "every day", what special character would you put in the {day of the week} position? 
      1. [ ] /
      1. [x] *
      1. [ ] ,
      1. [ ] ‐
  2. Suppose your Azure Function has a blob trigger associated with it and you want it to execute only when png images are uploaded. Which of the following blob trigger Path values should you use? 
      1. [ ] samples-workitems/{name}
      1. [ ] samples-workitems/{name}/png
      1. [ ] samples-workitems/{name}?png
      1. [x] samples-workitems/{name}.png
3. True or false: an Azure Function can have multiple triggers associated with it?  False
      1. Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to use multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions.
