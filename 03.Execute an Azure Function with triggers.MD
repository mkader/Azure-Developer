# Execute an Azure Function with triggers

* A trigger is responsible for executing an Azure function and there are dozens of triggers to choose from.

## Introduction
  1. Imagine a scenario where a busy hair salon has a recurring problem: customers commonly miss their appointments. 
  1. Appointments are reserved time slots, so if a customer misses an appointment, the salon loses money. 
  1. To improve the situation, send two types of reminder text messages, one that's sent as soon as the appointment is scheduled or changed, and a text message sent each morning to each customer who has an appointment that day.
  1. create a service that can be easily scheduled, updated, and scaled. 
  1. solve this problem using Azure Functions. Learn how to send the message at a specific time or when a specific event occurs. 
  1. Azure Functions supports a feature called triggers. Triggers are used to invoke your function code in Azure.
